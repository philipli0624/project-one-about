            <p>Virtual reality has grown from an experimental technology into an accessible and immersive digital
                platform. Early VR hardware was bulky and limited, with low-resolution visuals and simple software
                designed mainly for research. As display, tracking, and computing technologies advanced, headsets became
                smaller, more powerful, and easier to use. At the same time, VR software evolved from basic simulations
                into interactive, social, and creative environments. Today, VR blends hardware and software seamlessly,
                supporting gaming, learning, collaboration, and new forms of digital experience.</p>
