            <p>Virtual reality has come a long way—from an experimental technology to an accessible and immersive digital platform. In its early stages, VR was limited by both hardware and software and was mainly used for research purposes. As display, tracking, and computing technologies advanced, headsets became smaller, more powerful, and easier to use. At the same time, VR software evolved from basic simulations into interactive, social, and creative environments. Today, virtual reality seamlessly blends hardware and software, supporting gaming, learning, collaboration, and new forms of digital experience.</p>
